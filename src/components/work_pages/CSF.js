                In my final year of university I participated in a capstone project. Industry partners came to the University of Toronto with a problem and were paired with student groups to solve that problem. I worked on an interdisceplenary team of students to develop a solution for livestock tracking and wellbeing assessment. During the porject, we heavily leveraged artificial inteligence and machine learning to create an inteligent solution that could individually recognize sheep across the country as well as a system that could determine a sheep's wellbeing based on video evidence.

                During this experience, we faced many challenges and design choices that we worked as a team to solve. One of the biggest challenges is that we didn't know what would work because this type of thing hasn't been done before. After extensive research, we were able to break the project into smaller modules. The idea behind this was that we were able to assess different solutions for each module, and connect the ones that worked best together. This also allowed the team to more effectively break down individual tasks so that we could have a faster development lifecycle.

                Aside from the technical challenges, we faced several other challenges such as a lack of guidance and the fact that it wasn't possible to meet with everyone in person. We dealt with the first challenge, a lack of guidance, by reaching out to researchers around the world as well as contacting other professors to get advice and feedback on our process. We handled the second challenge by finding times that everyone in the team would be able to meet. With pre-specified meeting times, we were able to designate one person to communicate and schedule meetings with people that we weren't able to meet with in person.
