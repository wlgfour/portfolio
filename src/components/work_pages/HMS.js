            Used SLURM cluster to distribute data generation across thousands of concurrent processes. Integrated new data into the existing TensorFlow RNN pipeline for sequence to structure predictions. Worked on integrating the transformer architecture into the existing model. Coded and assessed novel methods of representing protein structure using tools from differential geometry and group theory. Developed a Python package and multiple data pipelines used in deep learning research at Columbia and Harvard. Package was also used to facilitate exploratory research when developing OpenFold. Built and tested equivariant graph convolutional neural networks on novel geometrical features. Assembled and presented concise and informative summaries of findings. Regularly read, implemented, and stayed up to date on techniques from the literature.
