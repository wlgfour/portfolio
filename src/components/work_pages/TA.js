                While at the University of Toronto, I was a TA for two different classes. In the first class, I helped students in class by answering questions and working through problems, hosted office hours where I walked students through assignments in a one-on-one settings, and invigilated exams where I answered questions.

                The second course I was a TA for was an enriched course where a small cohort of students partnered with a company (SensoAI) to build solutions for a problem that the company had. In addition to grading assignments and helping with lectures, I provided guidance to help the students build full-stack applications in an Agile enviromnet that solved the problem presented by SensoAI. This required frameworks and languages such as React, Spring Boot and SQL. I also helped with technologies like Docker, DigitalOcean, and AWS. I met with the students weekly to discuss the project and monitor team functionality, and when necessary, step in and help resolve conflicts.
